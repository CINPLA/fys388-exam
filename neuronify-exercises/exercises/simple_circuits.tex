\begin{Exercise}
In this exercise we will connect neurons to make simple circuits. In Neuronify, you can connect a neuron to another neuron just like any other other device, such as those we looked at in the previous exercise. 

\begin{ExePart}
Make a small network by doing the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create two neurons, and label them ``A'' and ``B''. You can set neuron labels by pressing a neuron, pressing the gear in the \gearpos  corner
