\begin{Exercise}[title=Directional lightsource]
In this exercise we will create a network that gives a signal when a lightsource moves from left to right, but not right to left.
Use the touch sensor, found under the sensory input, to simulate the light moving from left to right and right to left. Start with a linear array of light-sensitive neurons that can be connected with each other through lateral inhibition, and which converge onto one output neuron. 

\Question{Create a network that allows the output neuron to selectively respond to a spot of light that moves from left to right but not a spot of light that moves from right to left.}


Hint: Use lateral inhibitory connections in one direction only.
