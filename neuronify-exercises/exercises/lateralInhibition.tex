\begin{Exercise}
In this exercise we will create simple circuits that illustrate the concept of lateral inhibition, which is the 
capacity of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors. This type of inhibition occurs primaerly in 
visual process to increase the contrast and sharpness in visual response.
